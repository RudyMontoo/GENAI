# GENAI – Learning Repository

This repository contains all the code, experiments, and projects I am building while learning **Generative AI (GenAI)** and developing my **technical identity** in the AI/ML space.

It serves as a structured log of my hands-on learning, covering concepts, tools, and real-world implementations.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Track my **GenAI learning journey**
- Practice and experiment with **LLMs, RAG, agents, and AI pipelines**
- Build a strong **engineering-first understanding** of GenAI systems
- Maintain reusable code snippets and mini-projects
- Showcase consistent learning and growth over time

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

This repository may include (and will grow over time):

- Generative AI fundamentals
- Prompt engineering experiments
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Vector databases & embeddings
- LLM integrations (OpenAI, Groq, HuggingFace, etc.)
- LangChain / agent-based workflows
- Data extraction & parsing projects
- Streamlit-based AI applications
- Notes, experiments, and prototypes

Some folders may contain:
- exploratory notebooks
- partially complete projects
- refactored learning code
- proof-of-concept implementations

This is intentional — it reflects **real learning, not just polished outputs**.
